# Documentation

Use this directory for Markdown documentation files your team members want to be 
visible to the rest of the team. This is a great place for:

  - **User stories + clarifications from MVC3.**
  - Standards and guidelines.
  - Team meeting notes.
  - Explanations of architectural decisions (e.g. [ADRs](https://adr.github.io)).
  - Whatever else you want to be visible to the rest of the team in perpetuity.
